# Task Manager

### **Greetings**

Thank you for taking the time to review my project. I built this application using Maven and Spring, technologies that I believe are robust, efficient, and well-suited for developing scalable backend services.

My main goal is to show my ability to design and implement RESTful APIs, integrate with external systems, and write clean, maintainable, and production-ready code.

## How to run?
- Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/ce-fello/Task-manager.git`
- Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
- Run the Application (**TaskManagerApplication.java**)
## API URL
API endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/tasks`
## How to run tests?
1. **Run All Tests**  
   Navigate to the `src/test/java` directory in the **Project View**. Right-click the `java` folder and select **Run 'All Tests'** 

2. **Run Specific Tests**  
   Open a test class and:
   - Right-click the class name to run all tests in the class.
   - Right-click a specific test method to run only that method.
   - Run a specific test file

## **Final Notes**

Thank you again for reviewing my project and taking the time to go through this detailed instruction. I hope you found it clear, helpful, and enjoyable. I have designed the codebase to be clean, maintainable, and easy to navigate, ensuring that reading and understanding it will be a seamless experience.

If you have any questions, feedback, or further requests, I would be delighted to discuss them. I am confident that my work demonstrates my commitment to quality and my passion for software development. Looking forward to hearing from you!
